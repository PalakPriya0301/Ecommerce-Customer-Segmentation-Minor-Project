# Ecommerce-Customer-Segmentation-Minor-Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)** to segment e-commerce customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** metrics, the model identifies distinct customer personas to help businesses transition from generic marketing to data-driven, targeted strategies.
## 📂 File Information
**Please note the specific filenames used in this repository:**
* **`project.ipynb`**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning, K-Means clustering, and analysis.
* **`E-commerce Customer Behavior - Sheet1.csv`**: This is the raw dataset file (sourced from Kaggle) required to run the notebook.
* **`E.csv`**: The **output file** generated by the Python script. This file contains the original data plus the new "Cluster" and "Persona" labels and is used as the source for the **Tableau Dashboard**.

## 📊 Key Results
The analysis successfully segmented customers into **3 distinct clusters** (validated via the Elbow Method):

| Cluster | Persona Name | Avg Spend ($) | Avg Recency (Days) | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **High-Value Sleepers** | $547 (Low) | 36.4 (Inactive) | Largest group (172 customers). At risk of churning. Needs "Win-Back" campaigns. |
| **1** | **Promising Newcomers** | $985 (Med) | 19.9 (Active) | Engaged but lower spend. Needs Upsell/Cross-sell strategies. |
| **2** | **Top-Tier Customers** | $1460 (High) | 11.2 (Very Active) | Revenue backbone. Needs Loyalty rewards and exclusivity. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Visualization:** Tableau Public (Dashboard)
* **Concepts:** RFM Analysis, Feature Scaling (StandardScaler), Elbow Method, K-Means Clustering

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the **E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset** sourced from Kaggle.
* **Input File:** `E-commerce Customer Behavior - Sheet1.csv`
* **Key Features:** Customer ID, Total Spend, Items Purchased, Days Since Last Purchase, Age, Gender, Membership Type.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PalakPriya0301/Ecommerce-Customer-Segmentation-Minor-Project.git](https://github.com/PalakPriya0301/Ecommerce-Customer-Segmentation-Minor-Project.git)
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure `numpy < 2.0` is installed for compatibility)*
3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Open `project.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.
4.  **View Output:**
    * The script generates an `E.csv` file (labelled data) for visualization.
    * Elbow Method graph and Cluster Profiles are displayed inline.

## 📈 Dashboard (Tableau)
An interactive dashboard was created to visualize the personas.

## 🔮 Future Scope
* **Web Interface:** Build a Streamlit app for non-technical users to upload data.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Implement supervised learning to predict future churn probability.
* **Automation:** Connect to live SQL databases for real-time segmentation.
